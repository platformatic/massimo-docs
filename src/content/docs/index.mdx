## Quick Start

Generate a typed client for your API in seconds:

```bash
# For OpenAPI
npx massimo-cli http://api.example.com/openapi.json --name my-client

# For GraphQL  
npx massimo-cli http://api.example.com/graphql --name my-client --type graphql
```

Then use it in your code:

```js
import client from './my-client/my-client.js'

const api = await client({ url: 'http://api.example.com' })
const result = await api.getUsers()
```
