## Platform-Specific Clients

Massimo generates optimized clients for different environments:

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Node.js Client" icon="seti:nodejs">
		**Powered by Undici** - Uses the high-performance Undici HTTP client for optimal performance in Node.js environments. Features connection pooling, HTTP/2 support, and advanced request pipelining.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Web Client" icon="globe">
		**Powered by Fetch** - Uses the native Fetch API for browser compatibility. Lightweight bundle size with full support for modern web standards and browser features.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Node.js Client Features
- Built on **Undici** for maximum performance
- Connection pooling and keep-alive
- HTTP/2 and pipelining support
- Stream processing for large responses
- Native Node.js integration

### Web Client Features  
- Uses native **Fetch API**
- Minimal bundle size
- Browser-native error handling
- CORS support
- Works with all modern frameworks

## Quick Start

Generate a typed client for your API in seconds:

```bash
# For OpenAPI (auto-detects ESM/CommonJS from package.json)
npx massimo-cli http://api.example.com/openapi.json --name my-client

# For GraphQL with explicit module format
npx massimo-cli http://api.example.com/graphql --name my-client --type graphql --module esm
```

Then use it in your code:

### ESM (ECMAScript Module)
```js
import client from './my-client/my-client.mjs'

const api = await client({ url: 'http://api.example.com' })
const result = await api.getUsers()
```
